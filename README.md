# DataDoc
DataDoc is a product was developed by Apostolos Tapsas and Valiakos according ot their experience on Datascience.
# AIM
The project aims to make Data Science approachable to everyone without the need of the excess knowledge on mathematics and statistics. <br>
DataDoc can also be used by researchers and proffesionals who want to automate their jobs and get rid of uselessly repeated code. <br>
There is also an open source edition for DataDoc used for educational purposes in universities and school in our aim to bring people <br>closer to Data Science, Data Analysis and Machine Learning, providing also citations and info about the warnings and eroors that may occur<br>. In the future we aim to enrich our project adding more and more fields for the user to research, keeping the simplicity and its ease to use. 

# Description
 Datadoc software platform offers advanced statistical analysis, a vast library of machine-learning algorithms, image procesing <br>
 integration with bigdata and seamless deployment into applications. Its ease of use, flexibility and scalability make Datadoc accessible,<br>
 to users with all skill levels and outfits projects of all sizes and complexity to help you and your organization find new opportunities, improve efficiency and minimize risk.<br>
